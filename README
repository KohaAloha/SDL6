This module provides access to the Simple DirectMedia Layer (www.libsdl.org) to Perl6. The hope is for this
module to be implemented in pure Perl 6. Currently the module is broken do to a dependency on NativeCall and Inline::C 
libraries. Please have a look at the issues (https://github.com/PerlGameDev/SDL6/issues) to help out.
